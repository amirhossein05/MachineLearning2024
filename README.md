## Machine Learning Course Repository 2024 - KNTU University
Welcome to the Machine Learning Course Repository for the year 2024 at KNTU University. Here you will find a collection of homework assignments and projects completed as part of the coursework. This repository serves as a platform to showcase the practical implementations and understanding of various machine learning concepts explored throughout the course.

Mini Project 1: Linear Classifier

* Linear Logistic Regression:
Implementation of logistic regression, a popular linear classification algorithm, to model binary outcomes.
The code demonstrates the training process, including parameter estimation using techniques such as gradient descent or Newton's method.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score may be employed to assess model performance.

* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier:
Development of a SGD classifier, an efficient optimization algorithm suitable for large-scale datasets.
The implementation showcases the iterative optimization process, updating model parameters based on individual training examples.

* Data Generation with make_classification and drawdata:
Utilization of the make_classification function to generate synthetic datasets with specified characteristics such as the number of samples, features, and classes.
Visualization of generated datasets using the drawdata function to gain insights into their distributions and separability.

* Analysis of CWRU Bearing Dataset:
Exploration of the CWRU Bearing dataset, a real-world dataset commonly used for fault diagnosis in machinery.
Application of linear classification techniques to identify and classify fault conditions based on vibration signals.

* Analysis of Weather in Szeged 2006-2016:
Investigation of the Weather in Szeged dataset spanning the years 2006-2016.
Implementation of linear regression techniques, including Least Squares (LS), Recursive Least Squares (RLS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) approaches.
Analysis of weather patterns and trends using linear regression models to predict temperature, humidity, or other meteorological variables.
