# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains solutions to four different machine learning problems. Each problem explores a different algorithm and dataset, analyzing the results using various evaluation metrics and visualization techniques.

## Problems 

### Problem 1: McCulloch-Pitts Neuron
In this problem, we use a McCulloch-Pitts neuron to separate data in a rectangular space. We analyze the performance using different activation functions.

**Steps:**
1. Preprocess the random dataset
2. Implement McCulloch-Pitts neuron model.
3. Test on a dataset to classify points in a rectangular space.
4. Analyze the effect of different activation functions on the model performance.

### Problem 2: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on CWRU Dataset
This problem involves applying a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to the CWRU dataset, which includes three fault classes and one normal class. We use Stratified K-Fold Cross-validation and analyze the results using various metrics.

**Steps:**
1. Preprocess the [CWRU dataset](https://engineering.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/download-data-file).
2. Implement MLP with different activation functions and loss functions.
3. Use Stratified K-Fold Cross-validation for evaluation.
4. Analyze results using a confusion matrix, classification report, and plots of accuracy and loss.

### Problem 3: Decision Tree on Drug Dataset
In this problem, we apply a decision tree algorithm to the [Drug dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pablomgomez21/drugs-a-b-c-x-y-for-decision-trees) and improve the results using GridSearch and Random Forest.

**Steps:**
1. Preprocess the Drug dataset.
2. Implement a decision tree classifier.
3. Evaluate using confusion matrix and classification report.
4. Optimize the model using GridSearch.
5. Try to enhance results with a Random Forest classifier.

### Problem 4: Naive Bayes Classifier on Heart Disease Dataset
This problem focuses on using a Naive Bayes classifier to predict [heart disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). We analyze the results using a confusion matrix and classification report.

**Steps:**
1. Preprocess the Heart Disease dataset.
2. Implement a Naive Bayes classifier.
3. Evaluate using confusion matrix and classification report.
